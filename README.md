Overview
This R Shiny application provides a user-friendly interface for predicting the risk of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The application allows users to input various health parameters, and it outputs the probability of high AMS risk along with an approximated Lake Louise Score (LLS).

Features
Input fields for various health parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and symptoms.
Integration with a Python script that utilizes a pre-trained KNN model for predictions.
Display of predicted AMS risk probability and LLS score.
Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have R installed on your system along with the Shiny package. Additionally, the application requires a Python environment with specific libraries installed, including scikit-learn, pandas, and pickle.
